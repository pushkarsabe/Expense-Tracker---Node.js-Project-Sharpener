    <!-- This Boolean attribute is set to indicate to a browser that the script is meant to be executed after the document
    has been parsed, but before firing DOMContentLoaded.

    Scripts with the defer attribute will prevent the DOMContentLoaded event from firing until the script has loaded and
    finished evaluating.

    This attribute must not be used if the src attribute is absent (i.e. for inline scripts), in this case it would have
    no effect.

    To achieve a similar effect for dynamically inserted scripts use async="false" instead. Scripts with the defer
    attribute will execute in the order in which they appear in the document. -->
